        This project is a personal project to improve myself on Reactjs and to
        become proficient on fetching data, using <code>useEffect</code> and
        learning react structure. By the way am not a product designer or UI/UX
        designer so don't focus on what you see focus on the functionality of
        the project. And see how it is easy to navigate through even at smaller
        screen
